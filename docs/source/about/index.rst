This page gives some background on our work and why we think every datascientist should start measuring their power usage.

We first provide some element of comparison between CO2 emissions in :ref:`carbon_scale`.

We then give some background information on the power used by algorithms and its carbon footprint in :ref:`carbon_footprint`.

The page :ref:`server_power` references some key elements to select the hardware used (such as the processor or the PUE or even the electricity mix)

We finally give the reader some hints of algorithm to use to optimize its accuracy/efficiency trade-off in :ref:`accuracy_efficiency`
