# PyPowerGadget

This project aims at creating a python package that allows you to monitor the power consumption of any python function.

## Install

First of all you need to install the intel utility allowing you to monitor power consumption ([support](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget)):
* [Windows](https://software.intel.com/file/823776/download)
* [MacOS](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/91/6b/Intel%20Power%20Gadget.dmg)
* Linux : no need of power gadgets ;)

To install this package, clone this repo and run `pip install .`
